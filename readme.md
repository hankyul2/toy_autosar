## Project Overview

This is school project about learning autosar. We did this project by team. Our team consist of 4 members: Suchan, Hyunku, Seungmin, hankyul. This whole project is closely related to embedded system, especially automobile systems. We did this project in 8 weeks. Our main goal is to learn about standard of car development industry, which is very trendy technique in embedded software development.

## Project Contents

This repository contains 3 projects. First, baremetal programming project. This project is about develop hardware drivers. We did it by self-reading m3 board hardware specification docs. Second project is develop auto following car with nxt lego with osek os. In this nxt osek project, we develop two cars, first one is control car we can control by mobile phone via bluetooth and second one is car following first one. Third project is "AUTOSAR project". AUTOSAR is a term shorten for automobile open system architecture. We develop headlamp system with isolar-a, isolar-eve tools. 

## baremetal programming

Baremetal project uses arm cortex-m3 lpc1768 board and uses keil which is embedded software tools.
Here is board pictures. Details of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/hankyul2/toy_autosar/blob/main/baremetal_programming/docs/team_project_docs.pdf)

## nxt osek

NXT OSEK made 2 cars and this is two cars. Details of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/hankyul2/toy_autosar/blob/main/autosar/docs/team_project_docs.pdf).

## autosar

AUTOSAR project get helped from etas company. They give our class members isolar tool license for 3 months. Details of our project can be found [here](https://github.com/hankyul2/toy_autosar/blob/main/osek/docs/team_project_docs.pdf).
